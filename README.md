## My process

At first I started this challenge feeling confident, following the success of my previous challenge, but I later hit a roadblock when I got to centering the icons to text next to it. The Icons were slightly offset for reasons I didnâ€™t understand and I tried every way to centre an element that I knew of. I later searched on youtube for help and found that simply displaying as flex solves the problem simply! When I was done with that part, the rest was pretty fun.

### Built with

- HTML (semantic)
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learn the importance of using the right styling on the right parent element in order to achieve a certain goal. For example, using position absolute on the element and using position relative on the parent element.
